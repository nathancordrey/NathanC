# Icleand May 2017

## Day 1

We traveled to Iceland for a week long trip in early May of 2017. My husband and I were a young engaged couple just starting out in the wedding planning process. We decided the best option for us would be to rent a camper van and travel around the country. When we first arrived landed at the airport we took the bus into Reykjavik and met our guide "Thor." He ran the camper van company out of his home and met us at the bus stop. He then took us to his home with his wife and small child while he worked on how to print out the appropriate paperwork. After we got all the documentation signed and we convinced him we knew how to drive stick shift we were off with our bright green Kangoo. 

The first day we stayed in town and visited the Einar Jónsson sculpture museum, and the Listasafn Íslands (National Gallery) before heading to dinner. We had a delicious dinner at Berggson. 

That night we camped in the Reykjavik campground which was still fairly empty.
